															浅谈读完论文的一些体会

First of all,before I read the paper formaly,I  scan the paper fast.I find that ,many of the words I do not know its mean.Therefore,I have to turn to the google translation.But,after I read all the content,I find that I have hardly acquire any knowledge.The reason of the root is I just read,but there are many professional word that I haven't know.

Before I come into the deepcode lab,I really haven't read any paper.It's the first time I have read it. In fact, I truly have no any knowledge at all  about it. I try to find what words I don't know by baidu,I know the professional words.Finally,I can know some of the sentences that want to express.But it will not work.

In my opinion,one who want to acquire knowlege should learn it step by step.If someone learn the advanced knowledge before he don't know anything about it,I think  what he can obtain is few.
